# Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)

The Open System Interconnection model (OSI) is a conceptual framework that describes the functions of a networking system. 
There are 7 different abstract layers:  Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

### History of the OSI

In 1984 the Internalional Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed a document that defined a standard for the architecture of networking systems.


### Description of OSI Layers

#### Application 
The application layer is the top layer at layer 7 in the OSI model. It is in the host layer and part of the data in the Protocoal data unit (PDU). The function is High-level APIs, inclduign resource sharing, remote file access, directory services and virutal terminals. Examples of this are: HTTP, FTP, SMTP

#### Presentation
The presentation layer is the 6th layer in the OSI model. It is in the host layer and part of the data Protocol data unit (PDU). The functions of this is translation of data between a networking service and an application; inclufing character encoding, data comptression and encryption/decryption. 

#### Session
The session layer is the 5th layer in the OSI model. It is in the host layer and part of the data Protocol Data Unit (PDU). The function is managing communication sessions like continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmission between two nodes. Examples include RPC, PAP

#### Transport
The trasnport layer is the 4th layer in the OSI model. It is in the host layer and part of the Segment Datagram Protocol Data Unit (PDU). It provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and it is responsible for end to end recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer. Examples incldue SPX, TCP, UDP.

#### Network
The network layer is the 3rd layer in the OSI model. It is part of the media layer and the Packet Protocol Data Unit (PDU). The function of the network layer is structuing and managing a mutli-node network, including addressing, routing, and traffic control.


#### Data Link

#### Physical
